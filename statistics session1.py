# ANALYZING DATA
#any row data when collected and organised infrom of numerical format or table is called statistics

#statistics is also the mathmatical study of probability of events occuring based on known 
# quantitave data or a collection of data 
# everthing thing in statistics is based on data

# what is involved in numerical statistics
#1. you need to understand what descriptive statistics
#2. the types of measures in desriptive statistics

#what is descriptive statistics?
# its all about describing and summerizing data

#in this process we take two approaches
    #1. Quantitative way of approach
    #2. visual way of approach
    
# if your suing descriptive statistics, you can apply to 

# while forcuing on statistics you can forcus on
    #1. univariant -one variable
    #2. bivariant - two variable
    #3. multi variant - more variable

# how data is distributed
#measures taken
#1. central tendency 
    #center data, mean median and mode
    
#2. correlation or join variability 
    #Relation btn a pair of variables btn a data set
    # what we are finding: co- variance and co-efficient correlation
    
#3. variability
    # we shall use variance and S.D
